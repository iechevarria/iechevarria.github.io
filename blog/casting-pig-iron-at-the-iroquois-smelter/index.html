        <h1>Casting pig iron at the Iroquois smelter</h1>
        <p><img alt="Pig iron smelter" src="blog/casting-pig-iron-at-the-iroquois-smelter/pig-iron.jpg" /></p>
        <p><em>High-resolution scans of this image are available at the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/det.4a08071/">Library of Congress website</a></em></p>
        <p>This photograph shows men making pig iron at a place called the Iroquois smelter in Chicago sometime between 1890 and 1901. Molten iron was poured via a central channel to fill the small, regular trenches on the ground to form ingots. Once cooled, the ingots were broken apart from one another and readied for transport or storage.</p>
        <p>The smelter's brick structure has church-like arches, and the beams of light flowing through smoke suggest burning incense. The beauty is undeniable.</p>
        <p>But this image also contains evil. The same smoke that gives form to light was undoubtedly life-shortening for workers at the smelter.</p>
        <p>I’m reminded of this passage from Robert Adams’s essay <em>Photographing Evil</em> from his book <a href="https://aperture.org/books/beauty-in-photography/">Beauty in Photography</a>:</p>
        <p class="quote">
        "When we are young, we want art that is filled with the bitter facts, because we believe that evil can be overcome if we face it; when we grow older and begin to doubt this optimistic belief, we want art that does not simply reinforce the pain of our disillusionment.”
        </p>

        <p>Photographs like this one meet the requirements of young and old alike; "[they] urge reform, but seem to suggest that the need for it is not the most important thing to be said of life."</p>
