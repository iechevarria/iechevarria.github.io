        <h1>This blog is now statically generated</h1>
        <p>Before today, I hand-wrote all my blog posts in HTML. I’ve always known this isn’t ideal, but until a year ago, I wasn’t writing much. It didn’t seem worthwhile to invest the time and effort in setting up static site generation.</p>
        <p>Since I’ve been writing monthly updates, though, the manual work and boilerplate has been wearing on me. In addition, I started to fear changing my site layout at all since that would mean going back through every page I’ve created and changing each of them manually.</p>
        <p>For these reasons, I’ve now set this blog up to be generated statically - I now write the content of my blog posts as <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, a text format that's a lot easier to write than HTML, and I use a script to turn them into HTML pages on my site.</p>
        <h3 id="why-not-use-a-framework">Why not use a framework?</h3>
        <p>There are <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">plenty</a> <a href="https://gohugo.io/">of</a> <a href="https://hexo.io/">frameworks</a> for static site generation, but I decided to write a script myself for two main reasons. First, my situation was unique - I already had a blog, and it was plain HTML. I liked the way it looked. All I needed to do was make some templates and then populate them with content. I didn’t need the extra configurability or pre-made themes that these frameworks provide.</p>
        <p>Second, I try to spend time and effort learning things that generalize. I’d rather learn something new about programming than learn about the idiosyncrasies of a specific piece of software, in this case a static site generator, that I doubt I’ll use in any other context. (Jonathan Blow mentions the scourge of trivial knowledge about tools in his talk <a href="https://youtu.be/pW-SOdj4Kkk?t=2756">Preventing the Collapse of Civilization</a> around the 46 minute mark.)</p>
        <h3 id="results">Results</h3>
        <p>So I went ahead and wrote a quick, simple Python script that uses <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/">Jinja2</a> templates and Markdown files to generate this blog. I spent probably about the same amount of time writing the script as it would have taken me to get a static site generator configured to my liking. The script is crappy, but it’s totally adequate!  Both this <a href="https://github.com/iechevarria/iechevarria.github.io">website</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/iechevarria/blog-generator">script</a> are up on GitHub.</p>
        <p>This is the first blog post I’ve written in Markdown, and it was a much better experience than hand-writing HTML. I’m glad I made the switch.</p>
