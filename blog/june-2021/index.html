        <h1>June 2021</h1>
        <p>I spent June in Virginia visiting my family for the first time in 18 months. I showed up right as the Brood X cicadas were getting into full swing and left after they were nearly all gone.</p>
        <p>I made a brief trip down to Richmond, which is maybe my favorite city, and I was shocked to see how much it was changing – mostly for the better it seems. There is construction everywhere. Lots that had been empty or occupied by vacant low-rise industrial buildings are being turned into housing. The San Francisco Bay Area feels stagnant in comparison.</p>
        <h4 id="reading">Reading</h4>
        <p>I’ve been slowly making my way through <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691211381/trading-at-the-speed-of-light">Trading at the Speed of Light</a> by sociologist <a href="https://www.sps.ed.ac.uk/staff/donald-mackenzie">Donald MacKenzie</a>. It’s about high frequency trading (HFT), and so far it’s been great. MacKenzie lays out all the strange political decisions that have caused HFT to develop as it has – reliant on a connection between Chicago and New York – and the technology that moves information between these cities at almost the speed of light.</p>
        <p>This post, <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ErKzbKWnQMwvzRX4m/seven-things-that-surprised-us-in-our-first-year-working-in">Seven things that surprised us in our first year working in policy</a>  from the <a href="https://leadelimination.org/">Lead Exposure Elimination Project (LEEP)</a> was excellent, and I contributed after reading it.</p>
        <p><a href="https://hazlitt.net/longreads/legion-lonely">The Legion Lonely</a> is a total bummer of an article about men and loneliness, and it’s very good.</p>
        <p><a href="https://phenomenalworld.org/analysis/wage-share">Phenomenal World</a> had <a href="https://phenomenalworld.org/analysis/wage-share">a solid piece</a> about how the wage share of income dropped for 50 years and how that relates to the Fed’s view of labor.</p>
        <h4 id="listening">Listening</h4>
        <p>June wasn’t a big music month for me, but I came across this song off <a href="https://samuelorgan.bandcamp.com/">Samuel Organ</a>’s new album and listened to it a lot.</p>

        <p>I’ve been listening to the <a href="https://www.bradyheywood.com.au/podcasts/">Brady Heywood Podcast</a>, a podcast about engineering disasters (it’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPxHg4192hLDpTI2w7F9rPg">not the only one on engineering disasters</a> I listen to). I particularly liked this brief episode about the Tacoma Narrows Bridge that discusses how engineering as a profession lost knowledge it had decades earlier:</p>
