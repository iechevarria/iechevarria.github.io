        <p>
          These are some of the things I read and watched this May.
        </p>
    
        <h4>
          <a href="">Brick by Brick</a>
          by <a href="">David Robertson</a>
          and <a href="">Bill Breen</a>
        </h4>
        <p>
          <em>Brick by Brick</em> is a little disjointed. Robertson initially
          set out to write a book about "rules of innovation" with several case
          studies, but he became fixated on the story of Lego's rise and fall.
          This is completely understandable - Lego's crisis years in the late
          1990s and early 2000s are fascinating.

        <h4>
          <a href="">Q&A with Robert Adams and Gregory Crewdson</a>
          (video)
        </h4>
        <p>
          Robert Adams is a photographer and writer. I’ve read and reread his
          essays more than I have any other author’s work, and I’ve given
          several copies of his book <em>Beauty in Photography</em> to friends.
          Adams is careful and concise in his writing, and he’s just as strong
          in this interview.
        </p>
        <p>Some selected moments:
          <ul>
            <li>
              One of his least favorite parts of art is explaining his work:
              “Trying to explain what you’ve done has the unpleasant,
              embarrassing implication that you haven’t done it effectively.”
            </li>
            <li>
              Adams's argument for physical prints is convincing and new to me.
              He says a print gives you “the opportunity to see [the image] on
              the wall at times when you haven’t asked to [see] it ... 
              It helps you to know the picture better.”
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          I think the entire interview is worth watching, and I'd particularly
          recommend it if you have any interest photography.

          <a href="">Here I Stand, at Age 80</a> (video)
          by <a href="">Ted Nelson</a>
        </h4>
        <p class="quote">
          “I have to be immodest because I have no one to stand up for me, 
          only I have the big picture, and I can’t count on people figuring
          these things out after I’m dead. So here’s what I stood for from the
          beginning.”

        <p>
          It's about Ted Nelson
