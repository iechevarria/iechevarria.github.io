        <h1>November / December 2021</h1>
        <p>Happy belated New Year! I skipped November's update because I added a bunch of <a href="reading/index.html">book reviews</a> to this site.</p>
        <p>2021 was great. I gave a killer speech as best man at a wedding, I worked at three different companies (<a href="https://www.setsail.co/">1</a>, <a href="https://www.ladderlife.com/">2</a>, <a href="https://robinhood.com/">3</a>), I did <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>, I took three courses at <a href="https://bradfieldcs.com/">Bradfield</a>, I was admitted to and started the <a href="https://bradfieldcs.com/csi/">Bradfield CSI</a>, I <a href="https://github.com/iechevarria/reading-notes/tree/master/2021">read more</a> than I have since I was a child, and I <a href="blog/index.html">wrote more</a> in public than I ever have.</p>
        <h4 id="site-updates">Site updates</h4>
        <p>I made a few updates to this site in the past two months. First, like I mentioned above, I added more than a dozen <a href="reading/index.html">book reviews</a>. I'm still working through my backlog. I also updated this site's <a href="index.html">home page</a>, and there's now a section for popular posts. Finally, after a reader request, I added <a href="rss.xml">RSS</a> support.</p>
        <h4 id="reading">Reading</h4>
        <p>I read <em>The Poverty of Historicism</em> by Karl Popper in November. It was an odd book because it's so clearly of its time, making an impassioned argument in a dead debate I never knew existed. But there are gems in it, little pieces of common sense wisdom. I'll write about it more in the future, but for now you can read my <a href="https://github.com/iechevarria/reading-notes/blob/master/2021/the-poverty-of-historicism-popper-1957.md">personal notes</a>.</p>
        <p><em>Slaughterhouse-Five</em> lived up to its reputation. It was very good.</p>
        <p>I read a New Yorker article, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/a-ghost-in-the-family">A Ghost in the Family</a>, about artists Clare Rojas, Margaret Kilgallen, and Barry McGee after seeing a piece by Rojas in SFO. What a strange story.</p>
        <p>Jeff Vogel of <a href="https://www.spiderwebsoftware.com/">Spiderweb Software</a> wrote <a href="https://bottomfeeder.substack.com/p/six-truths-about-video-game-stories">a piece about video game stories</a>. Basically, narratives in games are typically terrible, and it doesn't take much to stand out. If you like this post, you might also enjoy his memorable GDC talk, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stxVBJem3Rs">Failing to Fail</a>.</p>
        <h4 id="watching">Watching</h4>
        <p>I got an HBO Max subscription for just this month to watch <em>The Matrix Resurrections</em>. It's a big mess that mostly makes fun of itself and Warner Brothers (by name) for existing. What a novelty it is to see so much money get lit on fire. I ended up watching <em>The Matrix</em> (1999) again, and I like it more every time I see it.</p>
        <h4 id="playing">Playing</h4>
        <p>I played the <em>Halo Infinite</em> campaign the day it came out. <a href="blog/october-2020/index.html">I'm a big Halo fan</a>. This one was ... pretty alright! It still has some of the problems that <em>Halo 4</em> and <em>Halo 5</em> did: tedious indoor combat and way too many buttons that need to be pressed. I'm thinking about doing a supercut of all the stupid buttons <em>Halo Infinite</em>. But the open world is great, and the sandbox is super fun. I hope we'll see some updates to the single player that extend the open world and add new biomes like desert and jungle.</p>
