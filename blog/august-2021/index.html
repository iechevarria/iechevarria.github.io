        <h1>July / August 2021</h1>
        <p class="date">September 7, 2021</p>
        <p>The last two months were a bit of a whirlwind. First, I left my job, the one I joined only a few months earlier. Not a good look for me! But I’m confident it was the right decision. My long-term goals changed recently, and my work didn’t align with them.</p>
        <p>Aside from off-boarding and trying to figure out what I want to do with myself, I spent a solid portion of July and August in <a href="https://bradfieldcs.com/">Bradfield</a>’s computer networking course. It was – as all Bradfield classes are – great!</p>
        <p>In August, I started the Bradfield <a href="https://bradfieldcs.com/csi/">Computer Science Intensive</a>, a year-long program. So far, I’ve been brushing up on C, learning Go, and getting better at using the Unix shell.</p>
        <h4 id="listening">Listening</h4>
        <p>This episode of <a href="https://oxide.computer/podcasts/kenneth-finnegan">On the Metal</a> with Kenneth Finnegan was just fantastic. This story of a one-man <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)">autonomous system</a> helped me understand so much of the material and political realities of the internet. And it was so much fun!</p>

        <p>I also listened to a lot of <a href="https://mansurbrown.bandcamp.com/">Mansur Brown</a>’s music this month.</p>

        <h4 id="reading">Reading</h4>
        <p>I finally finished <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691211381/trading-at-the-speed-of-light">Trading at the Speed of Light</a> in August, and I’d definitely recommend it to anyone who’s interested in how and why financial markets function as they do. In the next month or two, I think I’ll likely read <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/engine-not-camera">An Engine, Not a Camera</a>, another book by the same author.</p>
        <p><a href="https://nadiaeghbal.com/">Nadia Eghbal</a> wrote <a href="https://nadiaeghbal.com/asu">an article about Arizona State University</a>, which prioritized access (de-emphasized selectiveness) while also improving its reputation.</p>
        <p>Dan Luu’s <a href="https://danluu.com/why-benchmark/">post about the importance of measurement</a> was great. Some previous work with metrics (total epistemological nightmare) turned me into an enormous data skeptic, which I think was an overcorrection. This article helped me remember that yes, metrics <em>can</em> be meaningful and useful as long as you choose the right ones.</p>
        <p>This <a href="https://adamtooze.substack.com/p/chartbook-34-how-we-paid-for-the">post by Adam Tooze</a> makes the point that the money spent on the War on Terror didn’t actually crowd out or prevent social spending – it’s just that social spending wasn’t a priority. I will never give up a chance to bang on this drum.</p>
        <h4 id="writing">Writing</h4>
        <p>I hit the front page of Hacker News for the first time (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28418105">thread link</a>)! It’s funny because the post, <a href="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/flowers-make-a-nice-gift/index.html">Flowers make a nice gift</a>, is easily the least time-intensive one on this site. I’m glad it resonated with people, though! I had a genuinely great time reading all the comments in the thread.</p>
        <p>My favorite is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28418999">this one</a>: “Was this some kind of HN ranking hack or are we really this lacking in news today? Or perhaps so socially stunted as a group that we need this sort of thing pointed out? Wait, maybe don’t answer that.”</p>
