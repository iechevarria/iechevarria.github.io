        <h1>September 2020</h1>
        <p>
          The smoke is mostly out of the Bay Area, and I’ve been outside and
          running again. I’m a much happier camper, and I’m back to reading more
          substantial material. First, though, I finished a book about wood.

            With the Grain: A Craftsman’s Guide to Understanding Wood

          I’ve been getting into woodworking recently, and I wanted to
          understand more about wood’s properties before getting myself into
          trouble. I learned a ton from this book, but I mostly learned how
          temperamental solid wood is . It expands and contracts with humidity
          (I already knew that) and that variation is different across axes
          relative to the grain (I did not know that). You need to take care
          to use the right joints between pieces of wood and to allow for
          varying amounts of give. That sounds like a lot of work! I’m going to
          stick to plywood and maybe pine from the local home center for the
          time being.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love all the wood trivia that I’m going to carry around after
          reading this. Did you know that walnut was used for railroad ties and
          house frames? Or that live oak is so dense that it sinks in water? Or
          that molding on the sides of furniture was historically nailed instead
          of glued because nails can withstand expansion and contraction while
          glue won’t? Or that wood from a tree that grew at an angle is more
          brittle than wood from a tree that grew straight up?

            The Emotional Logic of Capitalism: What Progressives Have Missed
          </a>
          by
          <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/arts/about/our-people/academic-staff/martijn-konings.html">

        </h4>
        <p>
          <em>The Emotional Logic of Capitalism</em> is a solid critique of the
          most common progressive critiques of capitalism. I went in totally
          blind to this book, and it surprised me. The first half focuses on
          semiotics, theology, and pre-modern understandings of “economy” - not
          at all what I expected. I think it works? I need to write my notes
          down and sit with the book some more to see how it all ties together.
          Konings’s arguments are actually convincing without the semiotics
          stuff, but I want to see if there’s some depth I’m missing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I read <em>Capital and Time</em> by Konings this May, and I still
          think about it despite my frustration with the writing. This book is a
          similar deal: frequently dense and academic prose (I mean the fourth
          chapter’s title is “The Semiotics of Iconicity”) and lots of novel
          ideas. The writing in this book bugged me less than the last one -
          I’m not sure if it was me or the book that was different, but I had a
          lot more fun reading this one in the moment.
