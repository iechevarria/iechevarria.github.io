        <h1>October 2020</h1>
        <p>
          October was another heavy month for work. My highlight there was
          scaling up a core data pipeline to handle 10x the amount of data it
          ever had. It went well! Aside from that, I read a book and played some
          Halo.
        </p>

        <h4>Halo 3 has aged extraordinarily well</h4>
        <p>
          I bought Halo 3 on Steam this month, and I’ve been playing it a lot.
          It’s aged extraordinarily well. Right off the bat, the visuals look
          great. I think this comes down to the excellent art design and perhaps
          excessive ambition for 2007 - the game originally ran at 1152x640
          resolution, a clear step below the then-standard 1280x720 and a sign
          that there was some heavy lifting happening. 
        </p>

        <p>
          More importantly, though, the gameplay has held up. Halo 3’s sandbox -
          the characters, weapons, vehicles, mechanics, and the way they all
          interact - is incredibly deep and thoughtfully tuned. Instead of
          railroading the player down the “one correct path”, Bungie (the
          developers of Halo 3) took the time to tune their game systems to let
          the player choose how they tackle challenges.
        </p>

        <p>
          The scenario in the screenshot above exemplifies the freedom of player
          choice in Halo 3. In this encounter, the player needs to destroy two
          Scarabs, the big purple alien crab robots. The only way to defeat a
          Scarab is to break its power core, and how you do that is up to you.
          Here are some of the ways you can:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Blow the armor off the Scarab’s back with a tank or a Hornet
              (a flying vehicle with guns and missiles) to expose and destroy the
              power core.
            </li>
            <li>
              Break the Scarab’s legs by shooting at them with a tank or a Hornet.
              Jump onto the Scarab while it’s low to the ground, run to the area
              with the power core, and destroy it with whatever weapons you're
              holding.
            </li>
            <li>
              Drive a mongoose (an ATV) off a jump and land on the Scarab while
              it’s walking. Run to the power core and destroy it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fly a Hornet and land it directly on top of the Scarab. Jump out,
              run to the power core, destroy it, jump back in the Hornet, and fly
              to safety before the Scarab explodes.
            </li>
          </ul>  
        </p>
        <p>
          It takes a lot of confidence to let players do what they want, and in
          Halo 3, it paid off.

            The Time of Money

        </h4>
        <p>
          Another month, another book that I feel conflicted about. On one hand,
          <em>The Time of Money</em> makes many interesting points about time
          and financialization. I particularly liked the section where Adkins
          dissected the claim that the Great Recession would set women back by
          relegating them to housework. Implicit in this statement is the
          assumption that women cannot be unemployed - they are either working
          in a job or in a household. There are plenty of other similarly sharp
          observations in <em>The Time of Money</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, a large portion of the book is spent talking about
          this guy Bourdieu and his weird ideas about time, specifically that
          time moves as a result of people’s actions (at least that’s how I read
          it, this might be wrong). If you accept Bourdieu’s premises, you end
          up with some neat conclusions, most importantly that people aren’t the
          calculating actors that economics makes us out to be. My problem is
          that the premises are implausible (Adkins also seems to say as much),
          so why even include this stuff? Why not go a different route to get to
          the same interesting destination? It was a worthwhile read nonetheless.
