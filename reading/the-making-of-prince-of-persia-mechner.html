        <h1>The Making of Prince of Persia by Jordan Mechner</h1>
        <h4>Rating: ★★★★</h4>
        
        <p>I read <em>The Making of Prince of Persia</em> after <a href="https://twitter.com/oznova_/status/1674172555937337344">Oz recommended it</a>. I have no special fondness for <em>Prince of Persia</em>; I've never played it, and I don't intend to now. But I like making-of stories and have heard this one is inspiring.</p>
        <p>The journals are an unvarnished window into Mechner's creative process – there are long stretches where he doesn't work on <em>Prince of Persia</em> at all, where he does other things that are more interesting to him, like writing screenplays. And they're honest in other, cringe-worthy ways. I admire Mechner's decision to include it all. Some passages I would never put into writing, much less publish for a public audience.</p>
        <p>I took note of Mechner's relationship with money – while making <em>Prince of Persia</em>, money seemed purely a means to an end for him: he spent freely on hardware and seemed to really only want to make enough to pay his way through film school. He was nearly broke a few times. But when the royalties started coming in earnest for <em>Prince of Persia</em> and Mechner became wealthy, he wrote about how difficult it was to spend, how much he wanted to keep it.</p>
        <p>I wish the book had been structured or edited a little differently. The journals start out with Mechner already having bunch of industry relationships and a fairly established reputation – he already published one successful game, <em>Karateka</em>. I wish this book would have started with this and Mechner's earlier unpublished games (that's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1480297232/?coliid=ISMT7TXCBZM29&amp;colid=W25LBJUTGFAB&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it">a separate book</a>). And the last third of the book covers the years after <em>Prince of Persia</em>'s release – important to the story of <em>Prince of Persia</em> I guess, but not nearly as engaging as the actual making of the game. By his own admission, Mechner spent those two years goofing off.</p>
        <p>I read the Stripe Press edition of <em>The Making of Prince of Persia</em>, which is delightfully well-made – thoughtful page layouts and excellent printing and binding.</p>
