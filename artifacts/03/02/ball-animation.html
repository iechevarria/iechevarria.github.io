				The sequence of events for this animation is relatively simple: first, the lamp's bulb burns out, and 
				the lamp becomes discouraged. A ball then falls on the lamp, and its bulb starts working again. The 
				ball bounces away, and the lamp, thrilled about having light again, jumps. My storyboard for this
				animation is below:

			<p> 
				My initial animation did not have the hop at the end, and it just ended with the lamp watching the ball 
				bounce. I felt that the lamp came off too mopey, so I added the jump to liven it up.
			</p>
			<p>
				One of the principles of animation that I used was squash and stretch - in the image below, the
				stretchiness of the ball is clearly visible. 
			</p>

			<p> 
				I used another principle of animation, anticipation, when I gave the lamp a little dance before its 
				jump.

			<p> 
				Lastly, I used follow through when the lamp gets back up - the bits of the lamp farthest from the 
				base are the last to come to a full stop.
