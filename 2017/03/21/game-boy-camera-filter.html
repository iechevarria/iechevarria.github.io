			<h3>A Game Boy Camera Filter</h3>
			<p>
				I first came across <a href="http://www.claudiogomboli.com/"">Claudio Gomboli's</a> site while looking 
				for writeups on 35mm point-and-shoots - I'm pretty sure I was looking for an opinion the Olympus Stylus 
				Epic. Since then, I've been back to read up on others. In any case, I never expected that I'd end up 
				spending an afternoon reading about the Game Boy Camera.
			</p>
			<p> 
				Claudio Gomboli's <a href="http://www.claudiogomboli.com/essays/categories/blog/nintendo-gameboy-camera/">
				article</a> about this wonderful little camera goes over its history. The camera made its debut in 1998, 
				and at the time of its launch, it was the world's smallest digital camera. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Emulating the look of the camera wasn't particularly hard, but it did require a bit of thought. While 
				the Game Boy Camera was made to work with a screen that could display only 4 shades, it appears to be 
				able to capture at least 13 shades.
