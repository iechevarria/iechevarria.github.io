    <title>February 2022</title>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent many of my weekends and evenings working on the Data Structures for Storage and Retrieval module of the &lt;a href="https://bradfieldcs.com/csi/"&gt;Bradfield CSI&lt;/a&gt;. I think this may have been my favorite yet. Unlike your typical data structures class, the Bradfield one focused on practical applications of data structures and is centered around implementing a key-value database from scratch. In the process, I learned about skip lists, SSTables, and Bloom filters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vacuuming"&gt;Vacuuming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't like sweeping, so looked for and bought a vacuum that does a good job with hard floor pickup. In the process of searching, I fell deep into the rabbit hole of vacuum YouTube. Some videos have vacuum reviewers running vacuums through precise and reproducible vacuum tests. Others have vacuum enthusiasts demonstrating old vacuums and lecturing about vacuum history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's all amazing. The enthusiasm is contagious. I had tickets for a concert on one Friday night, but I stayed home and skipped it because I wanted to read about vacuums instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up with a Dyson V7 with a fluffy cleaner head, and I've been really enjoying it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="watching"&gt;Watching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure&lt;/em&gt; was excellent, and it was a more cutting satire I was expecting. I think it's extremely pessimistic about art's ability to change the world, a perspective I'm sympathetic to. I intend to write more about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also saw &lt;em&gt;La La Land&lt;/em&gt; for the first time this month. I initially thought it was a story about weak-willed people and that if the two leads were so in love, they should have made more of an effort to be together. But my girlfriend changed my mind a bit by pointing out how short-lived the central relationship is and that the movie sort of subverts the typical Hollywood romance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Bradfield School of Computer Science is phenomenal</title>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nobody asked me to write this, and I don't benefit materially from you joining.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing to take courses at &lt;a href="https://bradfieldcs.com/"&gt;Bradfield School of Computer Science&lt;/a&gt; is probably the best decision I've made for my career and my craft. If you're a software engineer, you should consider applying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a loose collection of thoughts about my time in the &lt;a href="https://bradfieldcs.com/csi/"&gt;Computer Science Intensive (CSI)&lt;/a&gt; and at Bradfield generally. I wrote this to make a slightly more personal case for taking courses at Bradfield and to fill in some gaps in existing information. If you're totally unfamiliar with Bradfield, go read the &lt;a href="https://bradfieldcs.com/"&gt;official site&lt;/a&gt; first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/bradfield-is-phenomenal/index.html#closing-thoughts"&gt;Closing thoughts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="my-background-and-why-i-started-taking-bradfield-courses"&gt;My background and why I started taking Bradfield courses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I studied computer science and math at &lt;a href="https://www.wm.edu/"&gt;William &amp;amp; Mary&lt;/a&gt;, a public university in Virginia. I did well in school – I graduated &lt;em&gt;summa cum laude&lt;/em&gt;, was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa, and got a computer science department award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I graduated with a lot of gaps in my computer science knowledge. I couldn't tell you how a computer physically operated, or how a database worked, or what an operating system's responsibilities were, or anything at all about computer networks. Some of this was because I was unlucky with course selection. The bigger reason is that I didn't absorb as much because I was learning to program at the same time I was learning computer science. These are different skills. Fighting to get a grip on language syntax and conventions occupied most of my attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few years of work, I was a much better programmer, but I started feeling the gaps in my computer science knowledge more acutely. I wondered why my code was slow and didn't have a good answer. I found out about Bradfield, and I signed up for a standalone course. It was more than I hoped it would be. I’ve now taken three standalone courses, and as of writing, I'm three modules into the CSI (about 1/3 of the way through). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="who-takes-bradfield-courses"&gt;Who takes Bradfield courses?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students at Bradfield come from a broad range of backgrounds. Most are people who did coding bootcamps and have been working for at least a few years. Others studied computer science at university – some of my classmates at Bradfield have undergraduate degrees from the best computer science departments in the world. All of my classmates have gotten enormous value from Bradfield, I think in approximately equal measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="quality-of-instruction"&gt;Quality of instruction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oz and Elliott, the instructors at Bradfield, are phenomenal teachers. Their knowledge of the subject matter is encyclopedic, but they also take teaching seriously as its own skill. Oz seems to read a lot of pedagogical theory (though he says not &lt;em&gt;too much&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/bradfield-is-phenomenal/index.html#note"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;), and Elliott continuously hones his courses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important thing that Oz and Elliott teach is a mindset: that everything on a computer is knowable with a bit of effort. Need to figure out what's going on with a network? Open &lt;a href="https://www.wireshark.org/"&gt;Wireshark&lt;/a&gt; and capture some packets. Not sure what a certain system call is doing? Check the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page"&gt;man page&lt;/a&gt;. Don't know how to use a protocol? Read the &lt;a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/"&gt;RFC&lt;/a&gt;. Want to figure out how this language feature works? Go to the source code. When a student asks something and the instructor says "huh, I don't know," they find out and in the process show the rest of us how to answer our own questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small list of other things I like about instruction at Bradfield:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A strong emphasis on learning by doing. Most class pre-work involves a hands-on exercise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Historical motivation as a teaching method. The instructors will take us back to a historical context and ask us how we'd solve a problem to help us understand how the world ended up as it is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tangents/rants. Get ready to hear about how programmers ought to be more like woodworkers and make more of their own tools, why the space / time complexity tradeoff is kind of a lie, and why microservices are not a great fit for most organizations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="workload"&gt;Workload&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CSI workload is heavy, there's no getting around that. You have two to three hour classes twice a week plus optional hour-long check-ins. Every class has pre-work. Expect to spend ten hours a week on CSI at minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should you join CSI, you should expect to fall behind at some point. Don't let it psych you out. Keep showing up to class. Oz and Elliott won't get mad at you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're thorough, you can easily spend as much time on Bradfield as you do at a full-time job. It's absolutely not necessary, though – I only say this because some people in my cohort did this for a few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="value-in-interviews"&gt;Value in interviews&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking Bradfield courses makes you a stronger candidate when interviewing for jobs. Some of my classmates have interviewed for jobs at level &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; and done so well that they received offers at level &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; + 1. I got offers that previously would have been unattainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example: I interviewed at an autonomous vehicle company last year. One of my interviewers was clearly perplexed when our session started and said outright that someone must have made a mistake. I had professionally only worked with Python, and his interview was about high-performance systems. "What's a Python programmer doing here," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said that while my experience was only Python and that I liked Python, I did care about performance and I understood why Python was slow. He said, fine, explain. So I used what I learned in Bradfield: I talked about how cache utilization in Python is bad for a few reasons (pointer-heavy data structures, everything is an object so takes more space, etc.). I was able to rattle off latency numbers to argue why this was so harmful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My interviewer’s demeanor changed completely. “It’s unusual for a Python programmer to think about caches at all.” He tested my knowledge a bit more, but the rest of the interview felt more like a friendly conversation than an interrogation. I had a great time, and I ended up with a good offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I would have passed this interview if not for my time at Bradfield. I was able to speak comfortably and confidently because I put the work in at Bradfield. I did the reading, and more importantly, the exercises, and that gave me a strong intuition for this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this is to say that you can just sign up for Bradfield and never have to study Leetcode-style problems again, but it makes you a lot stronger for everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="value-on-the-job"&gt;Value on the job&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bradfield's biggest benefit for me on the job has been simply having confidence that everything on a computer is knowable with a bit of effort. I can't give a dramatic example like I can with interviewing because real work isn't like interviewing, but I can tell you I'm faster and more capable, and that I have stronger engineering instincts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some benefits more immediately related to class material. Just last week, I debugged some microservices by reading network activity directly. One of my classmates sped up a critical process by at least a factor of 2 (maybe a lot more?) by applying knowledge straight from a course. Another upgraded his whole company from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="community"&gt;Community&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bradfield is the community of programmers I've been searching for. Students at Bradfield are serious in a low-ego, genuinely-trying-to-help-each-other way. It's energizing to be around other people with so much enthusiasm for the subject matter. I like being around everyone in my cohort without exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've tried joining other programming communities in the past, but they weren't what I was looking for. I found an undercurrent of insecurity and sweat that ruined the vibes for me. There's none of that at Bradfield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="money"&gt;Money&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year-long CSI is $19,500. The shorter 9-week course, &lt;a href="https://bradfieldcs.com/courses/ssba/"&gt;Software Systems: Behind the Abstractions&lt;/a&gt;, is $3,600. Either is worth it, easily. Sure, that's nothing to sneeze at, but it's cheap for what you get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm confident that if the CSI's price tag feels like too much, the program can get you to a place career-wise where it doesn't. Many students in CSI cohorts switch jobs, and some make twice as much as they did before. Recently, one quadrupled his income. I paid for CSI with a fraction of the signing bonus I got when I joined my current employer – a job I got thanks in large part to Bradfield courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obligatory disclaimer: the labor market is unusually hot right now so maybe don't count on doubling your income next year, but maybe don't count it out either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="accreditation"&gt;Accreditation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bradfield is not an accredited school. I think you can get a certificate of completion if you ask for one? I don't know, whatever. That's not why you do Bradfield. You do Bradfield to attain mastery, to actually get better in real life. You do Bradfield because &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oznova_/status/1479254530470518786"&gt;this stuff works&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously, though, we're lucky to work in an industry that &lt;a href="https://ozwrites.com/masters/"&gt;cares less about credentials than most others&lt;/a&gt;. There's some advantage to having a formal degree in computer science, but that largely ends after you get your first job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="other-students-reviews-of-bradfield"&gt;Other students' reviews of Bradfield&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't just take it from me that Bradfield is great – other students have written even more thorough accounts of their time at Bradfield:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="closing-thoughts"&gt;Closing thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're a software engineer, you'll likely benefit tremendously from courses at Bradfield. This stuff works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have questions about Bradfield, you should reach out to them via their contact information on the &lt;a href="https://bradfieldcs.com/"&gt;Bradfield website&lt;/a&gt;. If you're looking for a student perspective, I'm happy to answer any questions via email at &lt;a href="https://www.echevarria.io/mailto:ivan@echevarria.io"&gt;ivan@echevarria.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]&lt;i id="note"&gt;
Oz disputes that he read a lot on pedagogy: "[F]or the record, I don’t read up a whole bunch on pedagogy (some people *really* go overboard) but I do read some and do try to get actively better at teaching so I guess it’s the same sentiment :)"

    <title>January 2022</title>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;January was fun. I published a &lt;a href="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/the-matrix-looks-different-hulu-hbo-max/index.html"&gt;blog post about streaming versions of the Matrix&lt;/a&gt;, and it unexpectedly blew up. I got a ton of traffic from Google – I'm still not quite sure what people were searching for that brought them to my site. A Japanese website published &lt;a href="https://gigazine.net/news/20220108-matrix-hulu-hbo-max-color/"&gt;a translation&lt;/a&gt; and called me a computer scientist. Delightful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also continued the &lt;a href="https://bradfieldcs.com/csi/"&gt;Bradfield CSI&lt;/a&gt;. January covered computer networking, and it was, as Bradfield always is, excellent. I'm very eagerly looking forward to February's module: data structures for storage and retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="reading"&gt;Reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://leadelimination.org/"&gt;Lead Exposure Elimination Project&lt;/a&gt; published &lt;a href="https://leadelimination.org/annual-review-2020-21/"&gt;a review of their first year&lt;/a&gt;. Such incredible progress! I encourage you to &lt;a href="https://leadelimination.org/donate/"&gt;donate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.noemamag.com/chinas-inclusive-authoritarianism/"&gt;China's Inclusive Authoritarianism&lt;/a&gt; was a super interesting article about the way China's authoritarian surveillance state actually makes it more democratically responsive to its citizens. I think it's bad to be an authoritarian surveillance state (hot take, I know), but it's plausible citizens could become attached because of the real utility they get from it. In the past year, I've become interested in understanding how systems that harm people still have appeal and utility. I've mostly focused on neoliberal capitalism from the 1970s until COVID, but this lens is fruitful when looking at present-day China too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://moxie.org/stories/money-machine/"&gt;The Money Machine&lt;/a&gt; is a short anecdote about when the winning move is not to play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://palladiummag.com/2022/01/06/quit-your-job/"&gt;Quit Your Job&lt;/a&gt; makes me want to quit my job. Not soon, but someday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="watching"&gt;Watching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did my annual get-HBO-for-a-month-and-then-cancel in mid-December, so I watched some HBO shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How To with John Wilson&lt;/em&gt; season 2 was more &lt;em&gt;How To with John Wilson&lt;/em&gt;, so it was great. The episode about Bang Energy drink was the highlight of the season for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt; was okay. Maybe just stick to season 1? After finishing season 3, I was hit with an inescapable feeling that I had wasted a lot of time. The &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/12/13/on-succession-jeremy-strong-doesnt-get-the-joke"&gt;New Yorker article about how weird actor Jeremy Strong is&lt;/a&gt; is a lot more compelling than the show itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="listening"&gt;Listening&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vegyn released  &lt;a href="https://vegyn.bandcamp.com/album/dont-follow-me-because-im-lost-too"&gt;Don't Follow Me Because I'm Lost Too!!&lt;/a&gt;, and I listened to it all the way through as soon as it came out. It made my day. Here's one of the many tracks I liked:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Matrix looks dramatically different on Hulu versus on HBO Max</title>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Comparison of HBO Max and Hulu " src="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/the-matrix-looks-different-hulu-hbo-max/split.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="img-note"&gt;Hulu on the left, HBO Max on the right&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="note"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Hulu stopped streaming &lt;i&gt;The Matrix&lt;/i&gt; on January 1, 2022.&lt;/b&gt; You can stream &lt;i&gt;The Matrix&lt;/i&gt; with an HBO Max subscription, or you can pay to rent it from your service of choice.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It seems like a lot of you are searching "the matrix hulu" and ending up on this page. This was not my goal. But this is what happened, so I figured I'd give you the information you're actually looking for.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HBO Max has &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; (1999) available for streaming, and Hulu did until a day or two ago, but their respective versions look very different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; already has a history of extreme variation across versions. The initial DVD release had a neutral-warm color palette while the 2008 Blu-ray added a heavy green cast to match the sequels. &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;'s 2018 UHD Blu-ray release apparently hews closer to how the film looked in theaters with a more purple-blue tint &lt;a href="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/the-matrix-looks-different-hulu-hbo-max/index.html#note"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it seems that this version fragmentation extends to streaming releases. The Hulu version had a strong green cast, and I suspect it used the 2008 Blu-ray version at its source. Meanwhile, the HBO Max version is more purple and blue, so it seems likely that it came from the 2018 UHD Blu-ray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some comparisons with the HBO Max version on top and the Hulu version on the bottom:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-really-no-pad" src="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/the-matrix-looks-different-hulu-hbo-max/hbo6.jpg" alt="Screenshot of The Matrix from HBO Max"/&gt;
&lt;img alt="Screenshot of The Matrix from Hulu" src="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/the-matrix-looks-different-hulu-hbo-max/hulu6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hulu version's heavy green tint is apparent in this comparison. This is fairly representative of the versions' differences across the entire film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-really-no-pad" src="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/the-matrix-looks-different-hulu-hbo-max/hbo7.jpg" alt="Screenshot of The Matrix from HBO Max"/&gt;
&lt;img alt="Screenshot of The Matrix from Hulu" src="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/the-matrix-looks-different-hulu-hbo-max/hulu7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outdoor scenes in daylight get a little weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the shot above, you can see the green tint in Hulu's version, but you can also see that highlights roll off more gracefully. On the HBO Max version, Smith's forehead and the woman's blouse in the background are so bright that they lose definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-really-no-pad" src="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/the-matrix-looks-different-hulu-hbo-max/hbo2.jpg" alt="Screenshot of The Matrix from HBO Max"/&gt;
&lt;img alt="Screenshot of The Matrix from Hulu" src="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/the-matrix-looks-different-hulu-hbo-max/hulu2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the HBO Max version's highlights are way too bright, and the shadows on the building building's roof take on a too-bright cyan color. Hulu's version again has a green cast and controls its highlights better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-really-no-pad" src="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/the-matrix-looks-different-hulu-hbo-max/hbo3.jpg" alt="Screenshot of The Matrix from HBO Max"/&gt;
&lt;img alt="Screenshot of The Matrix from Hulu" src="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/the-matrix-looks-different-hulu-hbo-max/hulu3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another outdoor shot shows overcooked highlights on Neo's forehead in HBO Max's version while Hulu's handles them fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The over-bright highlights on the HBO Max version makes me think there may have been an error in how the file was created for streaming. It looks like someone took an HDR image and did a bad conversion. Or maybe the HBO Max's version of &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; looks great on a super high-end HDR display, and nobody tested it on more typical consumer devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you ignore the highlights conundrum, you're still left with the problem that &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; varies by streaming service. Some people genuinely like the green cast of the 2008 Blu-ray. Others want something closer to how it looked in theaters. When you steam &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;, you don't know which version you're going to get, and that stinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

    <title>November / December 2021</title>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy belated New Year! I skipped November's update because I added a bunch of &lt;a href="https://www.echevarria.io/reading/https://www.echevarria.io/index.html"&gt;book reviews&lt;/a&gt; to this site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2021 was great. I gave a killer speech as best man at a wedding, I worked at three different companies (&lt;a href="https://www.setsail.co/"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.ladderlife.com/"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://robinhood.com/"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;), I did &lt;a href="https://www.recurse.com/"&gt;Recurse Center&lt;/a&gt;, I took three courses at &lt;a href="https://bradfieldcs.com/"&gt;Bradfield&lt;/a&gt;, I was admitted to and started the &lt;a href="https://bradfieldcs.com/csi/"&gt;Bradfield CSI&lt;/a&gt;, I &lt;a href="https://github.com/iechevarria/reading-notes/tree/master/2021"&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt; than I have since I was a child, and I &lt;a href="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/https://www.echevarria.io/index.html"&gt;wrote more&lt;/a&gt; in public than I ever have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="site-updates"&gt;Site updates&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a few updates to this site in the past two months. First, like I mentioned above, I added more than a dozen &lt;a href="https://www.echevarria.io/reading/https://www.echevarria.io/index.html"&gt;book reviews&lt;/a&gt;. I'm still working through my backlog. I also updated this site's &lt;a href="https://www.echevarria.io/index.html"&gt;home page&lt;/a&gt;, and there's now a section for popular posts. Finally, after a reader request, I added &lt;a href="https://www.echevarria.io/rss.xml"&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="reading"&gt;Reading&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read &lt;em&gt;The Poverty of Historicism&lt;/em&gt; by Karl Popper in November. It was an odd book because it's so clearly of its time, making an impassioned argument in a dead debate I never knew existed. But there are gems in it, little pieces of common sense wisdom. I'll write about it more in the future, but for now you can read my &lt;a href="https://github.com/iechevarria/reading-notes/blob/master/2021/the-poverty-of-historicism-popper-1957.md"&gt;personal notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slaughterhouse-Five&lt;/em&gt; lived up to its reputation. It was very good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read a New Yorker article, &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/a-ghost-in-the-family"&gt;A Ghost in the Family&lt;/a&gt;, about artists Clare Rojas, Margaret Kilgallen, and Barry McGee after seeing a piece by Rojas in SFO. What a strange story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff Vogel of &lt;a href="https://www.spiderwebsoftware.com/"&gt;Spiderweb Software&lt;/a&gt; wrote &lt;a href="https://bottomfeeder.substack.com/p/six-truths-about-video-game-stories"&gt;a piece about video game stories&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, narratives in games are typically terrible, and it doesn't take much to stand out. If you like this post, you might also enjoy his memorable GDC talk, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stxVBJem3Rs"&gt;Failing to Fail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="watching"&gt;Watching&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got an HBO Max subscription for just this month to watch &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt;. It's a big mess that mostly makes fun of itself and Warner Brothers (by name) for existing. What a novelty it is to see so much money get lit on fire. I ended up watching &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; (1999) again, and I like it more every time I see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="playing"&gt;Playing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played the &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; campaign the day it came out. &lt;a href="blog/october-2020/https://www.echevarria.io/index.html"&gt;I'm a big Halo fan&lt;/a&gt;. This one was ... pretty alright! It still has some of the problems that &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Halo 5&lt;/em&gt; did: tedious indoor combat and way too many buttons that need to be pressed. I'm thinking about doing a supercut of all the stupid buttons &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;. But the open world is great, and the sandbox is super fun. I hope we'll see some updates to the single player that extend the open world and add new biomes like desert and jungle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Consistent daily price oscillations on the Steam Community Market</title>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/cs-go-price-oscillation/steam.png"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-really-no-pad" src="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/cs-go-price-oscillation/steam.png" alt="chart of CS:GO Operation Riptide Case median sales prices on Steam Community Market"/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="img-note"&gt;click the image above to see a full-size version&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a chart of median sale prices of the most-sold item on the &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/market/"&gt;Steam Community Market&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/Operation%20Riptide%20Case"&gt;Operation Riptide Case&lt;/a&gt; for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extremely regular oscillations in price jumped out to me immediately. You don't typically see this in other markets because it's a sign that money is being left on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first instinct was that this pattern was somehow related to CS:GO player count, so I pulled historical price and volume data from Steam and historical player counts from &lt;a href="https://steamcharts.com/"&gt;steamcharts.com&lt;/a&gt; to made this chart:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/cs-go-price-oscillation/chart.svg"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-really-no-pad" src="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/cs-go-price-oscillation/chart.svg" alt="chart of CS:GO Operation Riptide Case median sales prices on Steam Community Market, player count, and transaction count"/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="img-note"&gt;click the image above to see a full-size version&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="img-caption"&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Top&lt;/b&gt;: median sale price in dollars
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Middle&lt;/b&gt;: CS:GO player count
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Bottom&lt;/b&gt;: count of Operation Riptide Cases sold
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does look like it has something to do with player count. So what's happening? These cases are randomly given to players when they play the game, and some players immediately sell their cases for cash at market price. (If sellers cared about making a few extra cents, they could submit offers to sell above the current market price instead of selling at market price when prices are low.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect the oscillations are caused by different regions buying/selling/keeping cases at different rates. To illustrate, it might be the case that players in Europe sell more cases and buy fewer cases than players in the Americas, so the market price for cases is lower during European hours than American hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't see the same pattern in other CS:GO items. Only the Operation Riptide Case exhibits it, and that makes sense because it's the only item that is currently being distributed to players for simply playing the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why aren't there other market participants who flatten these oscillations out? Someone could buy cases cheap during European hours and sell for a profit during American hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The culprit here is fees on Steam Community Market transactions. CS:GO items on the Community Market are subject to a 15% fee on every transaction: 5% for Steam plus 10% for CS:GO specifically. This means that you can only make money on price swings greater than 15%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look at the actual price daily swings, they're typically smaller than 15%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-really-no-pad" src="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/cs-go-price-oscillation/percents.svg" alt="Percentage difference between minimum hourly median and maximum hourly median sale price by day"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="img-note"&gt;
    Percentage difference between minimum hourly median and maximum hourly median sale price by day
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On some days, the percentage approaches 15%. I suspect that on these days, there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; some market participants buying cheap, holding for a few hours, selling high, and making a cent or two per case after fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the min and max values used in the chart are median hourly sale price, so some transactions happened at higher/lower values. Therefore individual cases may have been bought and then sold profitably after fees.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>An interesting way to pack bytes into a MIDI SysEx message</title>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Here’s a little thought experiment: how would you transmit 8-bit bytes via messages that let you encode only 7 bits at a time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The engineers at &lt;a href="https://www.digitech.com/"&gt;DigiTech&lt;/a&gt; handled this exact problem on their DHP-55 effects unit in the 1990s. They needed to transmit 8-bit bytes to the unit via a MIDI SysEx message. Every byte in a SysEx message must have its most significant bit set to 0, so there are only 7 bits available per byte for sending data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how they describe their approach in the DHP-55 manual:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="todo2" src="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/midi-sysex/scan1.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(For clarity, I'm going to call the 8-bit bytes we want to transmit the "real" bytes and the bytes with 7 bits available that we have to use the "send" bytes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The engineers chose to do the following: pack 7 "real" bytes into 8 "send" bytes at a time. Take the most significant bit of each of the "real" bytes and put them into the first "send" byte. Then take the remaining 7 bits of each of the "real" bytes and put them in each of the remaining "send" bytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've illustrated an example of this packing below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="todo" src="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/midi-sysex/midi-bits.svg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="img-caption"&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Left&lt;/b&gt;: The 7 (8-bit) "real" bytes we want to transmit
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Right&lt;/b&gt;: The 8 "send" bytes. The first byte contains 0 and the most significant bit of each of the 7 "real" bytes. The following 7 "send" bytes contain 0 and the 7 remaining bits of each of the 7 "real" bytes.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find this a pretty interesting solution to the problem. It's not my first instinct – I would have just mashed the bytes together instead of sending the most significant bits separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why the engineers at DigiTech separate the most significant bits? One reason might be that it makes hex dumps a lot easier to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you take a look at the manual, you can see that much of the data that's being transmitted is small integers (less than 128) where the most significant bit is already 0. This means that many of the "send" bytes will have identical values to those in the "real" bytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank number, preset number, number of effects, effect number, number of parameters, effect version – all of these will likely be less than 128.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="todo3" src="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/midi-sysex/scan2.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the DigiTech engineers had gone with my approach, "send" bytes would not resemble "real" bytes, and they wouldn't be able to use hex dumps for spot checks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you know another reason, please reach out!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Casting pig iron at the Iroquois smelter</title>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pig iron smelter" src="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/casting-pig-iron-at-the-iroquois-smelter/pig-iron.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;High-resolution scans of this image are available at the &lt;a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/det.4a08071/"&gt;Library of Congress website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This photograph shows men making pig iron at a place called the Iroquois smelter in Chicago sometime between 1890 and 1901. Molten iron was poured via a central channel to fill the small, regular trenches on the ground to form ingots. Once cooled, the ingots were broken apart from one another and readied for transport or storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smelter's brick structure has church-like arches, and the beams of light flowing through smoke suggest burning incense. The beauty is undeniable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this image also contains evil. The same smoke that gives form to light was undoubtedly life-shortening for workers at the smelter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m reminded of this passage from Robert Adams’s essay &lt;em&gt;Photographing Evil&lt;/em&gt; from his book &lt;a href="https://aperture.org/books/beauty-in-photography/"&gt;Beauty in Photography&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="quote"&gt;
"When we are young, we want art that is filled with the bitter facts, because we believe that evil can be overcome if we face it; when we grow older and begin to doubt this optimistic belief, we want art that does not simply reinforce the pain of our disillusionment.”
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photographs like this one meet the requirements of young and old alike; "[they] urge reform, but seem to suggest that the need for it is not the most important thing to be said of life."&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>October 2021</title>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent most of October studying and working. I'm currently in the Advanced Programming module of the &lt;a href="https://bradfieldcs.com/csi/"&gt;Bradfield CSI&lt;/a&gt; which covers the Go programming language in depth. Learning the guts behind some of Go's core features – goroutines, channels, the scheduler – has been rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;October was my second month working at a large tech company, and it's still good. One of the best parts of working at a larger-but-not-quite-enormous tech company is that I'm finally working hands-on with technologies that I only knew by name before. I've been having a lot of moments where I go something like &lt;em&gt;"oh that's what Airflow is for."&lt;/em&gt; It's not just that I have more tools, it's that I've seen how other people use them effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="reading"&gt;Reading&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class="quote"&gt;
"There is always a subjective aspect in landscape art, something in the picture that tells us as much about who is behind the camera as about what is in front of it."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did my annual re-read of Robert Adams's &lt;a href="https://aperture.org/books/beauty-in-photography/"&gt;Beauty in Photography&lt;/a&gt; in October. It's short – just eight brief essays in fewer than 100 pages of text – but it is so full of insight. It's probably the book that means the most to me. I first read it at an important time, and it was enormously clarifying for my own work. In particular, Adams's insistence that great landscape photographs must have an autobiographical element led me to my best photographs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This short film about an diver who maintains Mexico City's sewage system is excellent. I'm not sure how I ended up on it, but I'm glad I did!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw Dune and thought it was great. I like everything Denis Villeneuve does, so that's not much of surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Bond: New Sequel was not great. The first half was good, but the second half was bloated with a videogame-like body count and cloying ending. Also the big maguffin was NANOMACHINES. Stupid! I yearn for the days when 007's big mission is getting ahold of a special typewriter like in &lt;em&gt;From Russia with Love&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A brief anecdote about a good leader</title>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;A lifetime ago, I worked on products at an early stage startup. One of these was an offering for live chat agents, the people who you message in the chat bubbles that pop up on web pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My team was a few weeks from launching a prototype with our first customer, and we presented our progress at a company all-hands. During that meeting, a coworker suggested that we go to the customer’s website and send a message to one of the chat agents live to show everyone how such a system usually works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the co-founders immediately shot the idea down. “How would you like it if someone showed up unannounced and interrupted your work?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I like most about the co-founder’s response is that he went straight for the moral reason. He didn’t say it could be bad for the business (it probably wouldn’t have been). To him, the biggest issue is that it wasn’t considerate – we shouldn’t waste a chat agent’s time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still think about this brief exchange. When I left that company, I had an exit interview with that co-founder where I mentioned how much of an impression his response made on me. He didn’t remember it at all, even after I recounted it in detail. I realized his response was just a reflex for him, and I think that’s more evidence of his integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the kind of person I want to work for or with: ethical and conscientious without even having to try.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
