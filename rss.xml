    <title>January 2022</title>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;January was fun. I published a &lt;a href="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/the-matrix-looks-different-hulu-hbo-max/index.html"&gt;blog post about streaming versions of the Matrix&lt;/a&gt;, and it unexpectedly blew up. I got a ton of traffic from Google – I'm still not quite sure what people were searching for that brought them to my site. A Japanese website published &lt;a href="https://gigazine.net/news/20220108-matrix-hulu-hbo-max-color/"&gt;a translation&lt;/a&gt; and called me a computer scientist. Delightful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also continued the &lt;a href="https://bradfieldcs.com/csi/"&gt;Bradfield CSI&lt;/a&gt;. January covered computer networking, and it was, as Bradfield always is, excellent. I'm very eagerly looking forward to February's module: distributed systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://leadelimination.org/"&gt;Lead Exposure Elimination Project&lt;/a&gt; published &lt;a href="https://leadelimination.org/annual-review-2020-21/"&gt;a review of their first year&lt;/a&gt;. Such incredible progress! I encourage you to &lt;a href="https://leadelimination.org/donate/"&gt;donate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.noemamag.com/chinas-inclusive-authoritarianism/"&gt;China's Inclusive Authoritarianism&lt;/a&gt; was a super interesting article about the way China's authoritarian surveillance state actually makes it more democratically responsive to its citizens. I think it's bad to be an authoritarian surveillance state (hot take, I know), but it's plausible citizens could become attached because of the real utility they get from it. In the past year, I've become interested in understanding how systems that harm people still have appeal and utility. I've mostly focused on neoliberal capitalism from the 1970s until COVID, but this lens is fruitful when looking at present-day China too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://moxie.org/stories/money-machine/"&gt;The Money Machine&lt;/a&gt; is a short anecdote about when the winning move is not to play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://palladiummag.com/2022/01/06/quit-your-job/"&gt;Quit Your Job&lt;/a&gt; makes me want to quit my job. Not soon, but someday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Watching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did my annual get-HBO-for-a-month-and-then-cancel in mid-December, so I watched some HBO shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How To with John Wilson&lt;/em&gt; season 2 was more &lt;em&gt;How To with John Wilson&lt;/em&gt;, so it was great. The episode about Bang Energy drink was the highlight of the season for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt; was okay. Maybe just stick to season 1? After finishing season 3, I was hit with an inescapable feeling that I had wasted a lot of time. The &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/12/13/on-succession-jeremy-strong-doesnt-get-the-joke"&gt;New Yorker article about how weird actor Jeremy Strong is&lt;/a&gt; is a lot more compelling than the show itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Listening&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vegyn released  &lt;a href="https://vegyn.bandcamp.com/album/dont-follow-me-because-im-lost-too"&gt;Don't Follow Me Because I'm Lost Too!!&lt;/a&gt;, and I listened to it all the way through as soon as it came out. It made my day. Here's one of the many tracks I liked:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Matrix looks dramatically different on Hulu versus on HBO Max</title>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Comparison of HBO Max and Hulu " src="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/the-matrix-looks-different-hulu-hbo-max/split.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="img-note"&gt;Hulu on the left, HBO Max on the right&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="note"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Hulu stopped streaming &lt;i&gt;The Matrix&lt;/i&gt; on January 1, 2022.&lt;/b&gt; You can stream &lt;i&gt;The Matrix&lt;/i&gt; with an HBO Max subscription, or you can pay to rent it from your service of choice.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It seems like a lot of you are searching "the matrix hulu" and ending up on this page. This was not my goal. But this is what happened, so I figured I'd give you the information you're actually looking for.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HBO Max has &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; (1999) available for streaming, and Hulu did until a day or two ago, but their respective versions look very different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; already has a history of extreme variation across versions. The initial DVD release had a neutral-warm color palette while the 2008 Blu-ray added a heavy green cast to match the sequels. &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;'s 2018 UHD Blu-ray release apparently hews closer to how the film looked in theaters with a more purple-blue tint &lt;a href="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/the-matrix-looks-different-hulu-hbo-max/index.html#note"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it seems that this version fragmentation extends to streaming releases. The Hulu version had a strong green cast, and I suspect it used the 2008 Blu-ray version at its source. Meanwhile, the HBO Max version is more purple and blue, so it seems likely that it came from the 2018 UHD Blu-ray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some comparisons with the HBO Max version on top and the Hulu version on the bottom:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-really-no-pad" src="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/the-matrix-looks-different-hulu-hbo-max/hbo6.jpg" alt="Screenshot of The Matrix from HBO Max"/&gt;
&lt;img alt="Screenshot of The Matrix from Hulu" src="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/the-matrix-looks-different-hulu-hbo-max/hulu6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hulu version's heavy green tint is apparent in this comparison. This is fairly representative of the versions' differences across the entire film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-really-no-pad" src="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/the-matrix-looks-different-hulu-hbo-max/hbo7.jpg" alt="Screenshot of The Matrix from HBO Max"/&gt;
&lt;img alt="Screenshot of The Matrix from Hulu" src="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/the-matrix-looks-different-hulu-hbo-max/hulu7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outdoor scenes in daylight get a little weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the shot above, you can see the green tint in Hulu's version, but you can also see that highlights roll off more gracefully. On the HBO Max version, Smith's forehead and the woman's blouse in the background are so bright that they lose definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-really-no-pad" src="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/the-matrix-looks-different-hulu-hbo-max/hbo2.jpg" alt="Screenshot of The Matrix from HBO Max"/&gt;
&lt;img alt="Screenshot of The Matrix from Hulu" src="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/the-matrix-looks-different-hulu-hbo-max/hulu2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the HBO Max version's highlights are way too bright, and the shadows on the building building's roof take on a too-bright cyan color. Hulu's version again has a green cast and controls its highlights better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-really-no-pad" src="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/the-matrix-looks-different-hulu-hbo-max/hbo3.jpg" alt="Screenshot of The Matrix from HBO Max"/&gt;
&lt;img alt="Screenshot of The Matrix from Hulu" src="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/the-matrix-looks-different-hulu-hbo-max/hulu3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another outdoor shot shows overcooked highlights on Neo's forehead in HBO Max's version while Hulu's handles them fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The over-bright highlights on the HBO Max version makes me think there may have been an error in how the file was created for streaming. It looks like someone took an HDR image and did a bad conversion. Or maybe the HBO Max's version of &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; looks great on a super high-end HDR display, and nobody tested it on more typical consumer devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you ignore the highlights conundrum, you're still left with the problem that &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; varies by streaming service. Some people genuinely like the green cast of the 2008 Blu-ray. Others want something closer to how it looked in theaters. When you steam &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;, you don't know which version you're going to get, and that stinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>November / December 2021</title>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy belated New Year! I skipped November's update because I added a bunch of &lt;a href="https://www.echevarria.io/reading/https://www.echevarria.io/index.html"&gt;book reviews&lt;/a&gt; to this site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2021 was great. I gave a killer speech as best man at a wedding, I worked at three different companies (&lt;a href="https://www.setsail.co/"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.ladderlife.com/"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://robinhood.com/"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;), I did &lt;a href="https://www.recurse.com/"&gt;Recurse Center&lt;/a&gt;, I took three courses at &lt;a href="https://bradfieldcs.com/"&gt;Bradfield&lt;/a&gt;, I was admitted to and started the &lt;a href="https://bradfieldcs.com/csi/"&gt;Bradfield CSI&lt;/a&gt;, I &lt;a href="https://github.com/iechevarria/reading-notes/tree/master/2021"&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt; than I have since I was a child, and I &lt;a href="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/https://www.echevarria.io/index.html"&gt;wrote more&lt;/a&gt; in public than I ever have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Site updates&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a few updates to this site in the past two months. First, like I mentioned above, I added more than a dozen &lt;a href="https://www.echevarria.io/reading/https://www.echevarria.io/index.html"&gt;book reviews&lt;/a&gt;. I'm still working through my backlog. I also updated this site's &lt;a href="https://www.echevarria.io/index.html"&gt;home page&lt;/a&gt;, and there's now a section for popular posts. Finally, after a reader request, I added &lt;a href="https://www.echevarria.io/rss.xml"&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Reading&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read &lt;em&gt;The Poverty of Historicism&lt;/em&gt; by Karl Popper in November. It was an odd book because it's so clearly of its time, making an impassioned argument in a dead debate I never knew existed. But there are gems in it, little pieces of common sense wisdom. I'll write about it more in the future, but for now you can read my &lt;a href="https://github.com/iechevarria/reading-notes/blob/master/2021/the-poverty-of-historicism-popper-1957.md"&gt;personal notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slaughterhouse-Five&lt;/em&gt; lived up to its reputation. It was very good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read a New Yorker article, &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/a-ghost-in-the-family"&gt;A Ghost in the Family&lt;/a&gt;, about artists Clare Rojas, Margaret Kilgallen, and Barry McGee after seeing a piece by Rojas in SFO. What a strange story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff Vogel of &lt;a href="https://www.spiderwebsoftware.com/"&gt;Spiderweb Software&lt;/a&gt; wrote &lt;a href="https://bottomfeeder.substack.com/p/six-truths-about-video-game-stories"&gt;a piece about video game stories&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, narratives in games are typically terrible, and it doesn't take much to stand out. If you like this post, you might also enjoy his memorable GDC talk, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stxVBJem3Rs"&gt;Failing to Fail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Watching&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got an HBO Max subscription for just this month to watch &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt;. It's a big mess that mostly makes fun of itself and Warner Brothers (by name) for existing. What a novelty it is to see so much money get lit on fire. I ended up watching &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; (1999) again, and I like it more every time I see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Playing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played the &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; campaign the day it came out. &lt;a href="blog/october-2020/https://www.echevarria.io/index.html"&gt;I'm a big Halo fan&lt;/a&gt;. This one was ... pretty alright! It still has some of the problems that &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Halo 5&lt;/em&gt; did: tedious indoor combat and way too many buttons that need to be pressed. I'm thinking about doing a supercut of all the stupid buttons &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;. But the open world is great, and the sandbox is super fun. I hope we'll see some updates to the single player that extend the open world and add new biomes like desert and jungle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Consistent daily price oscillations on the Steam Community Market</title>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/cs-go-price-oscillation/steam.png"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-really-no-pad" src="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/cs-go-price-oscillation/steam.png" alt="chart of CS:GO Operation Riptide Case median sales prices on Steam Community Market"/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="img-note"&gt;click the image above to see a full-size version&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a chart of median sale prices of the most-sold item on the &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/market/"&gt;Steam Community Market&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/Operation%20Riptide%20Case"&gt;Operation Riptide Case&lt;/a&gt; for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extremely regular oscillations in price jumped out to me immediately. You don't typically see this in other markets because it's a sign that money is being left on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first instinct was that this pattern was somehow related to CS:GO player count, so I pulled historical price and volume data from Steam and historical player counts from &lt;a href="https://steamcharts.com/"&gt;steamcharts.com&lt;/a&gt; to made this chart:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/cs-go-price-oscillation/chart.svg"&gt;
  &lt;img class="img-really-no-pad" src="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/cs-go-price-oscillation/chart.svg" alt="chart of CS:GO Operation Riptide Case median sales prices on Steam Community Market, player count, and transaction count"/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="img-note"&gt;click the image above to see a full-size version&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="img-caption"&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Top&lt;/b&gt;: median sale price in dollars
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Middle&lt;/b&gt;: CS:GO player count
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Bottom&lt;/b&gt;: count of Operation Riptide Cases sold
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does look like it has something to do with player count. So what's happening? These cases are randomly given to players when they play the game, and some players immediately sell their cases for cash at market price. (If sellers cared about making a few extra cents, they could submit offers to sell above the current market price instead of selling at market price when prices are low.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect the oscillations are caused by different regions buying/selling/keeping cases at different rates. To illustrate, it might be the case that players in Europe sell more cases and buy fewer cases than players in the Americas, so the market price for cases is lower during European hours than American hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't see the same pattern in other CS:GO items. Only the Operation Riptide Case exhibits it, and that makes sense because it's the only item that is currently being distributed to players for simply playing the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why aren't there other market participants who flatten these oscillations out? Someone could buy cases cheap during European hours and sell for a profit during American hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The culprit here is fees on Steam Community Market transactions. CS:GO items on the Community Market are subject to a 15% fee on every transaction: 5% for Steam plus 10% for CS:GO specifically. This means that you can only make money on price swings greater than 15%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look at the actual price daily swings, they're typically smaller than 15%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-really-no-pad" src="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/cs-go-price-oscillation/percents.svg" alt="Percentage difference between minimum hourly median and maximum hourly median sale price by day"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="img-note"&gt;
    Percentage difference between minimum hourly median and maximum hourly median sale price by day
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On some days, the percentage approaches 15%. I suspect that on these days, there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; some market participants buying cheap, holding for a few hours, selling high, and making a cent or two per case after fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the min and max values used in the chart are median hourly sale price, so some transactions happened at higher/lower values. Therefore individual cases may have been bought and then sold profitably after fees.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>An interesting way to pack bytes into a MIDI SysEx message</title>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Here’s a little thought experiment: how would you transmit 8-bit bytes via messages that let you encode only 7 bits at a time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The engineers at &lt;a href="https://www.digitech.com/"&gt;DigiTech&lt;/a&gt; handled this exact problem on their DHP-55 effects unit in the 1990s. They needed to transmit 8-bit bytes to the unit via a MIDI SysEx message. Every byte in a SysEx message must have its most significant bit set to 0, so there are only 7 bits available per byte for sending data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how they describe their approach in the DHP-55 manual:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="todo2" src="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/midi-sysex/scan1.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(For clarity, I'm going to call the 8-bit bytes we want to transmit the "real" bytes and the bytes with 7 bits available that we have to use the "send" bytes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The engineers chose to do the following: pack 7 "real" bytes into 8 "send" bytes at a time. Take the most significant bit of each of the "real" bytes and put them into the first "send" byte. Then take the remaining 7 bits of each of the "real" bytes and put them in each of the remaining "send" bytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've illustrated an example of this packing below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="todo" src="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/midi-sysex/midi-bits.svg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="img-caption"&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Left&lt;/b&gt;: The 7 (8-bit) "real" bytes we want to transmit
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Right&lt;/b&gt;: The 8 "send" bytes. The first byte contains 0 and the most significant bit of each of the 7 "real" bytes. The following 7 "send" bytes contain 0 and the 7 remaining bits of each of the 7 "real" bytes.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find this a pretty interesting solution to the problem. It's not my first instinct – I would have just mashed the bytes together instead of sending the most significant bits separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why the engineers at DigiTech separate the most significant bits? One reason might be that it makes hex dumps a lot easier to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you take a look at the manual, you can see that much of the data that's being transmitted is small integers (less than 128) where the most significant bit is already 0. This means that many of the "send" bytes will have identical values to those in the "real" bytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank number, preset number, number of effects, effect number, number of parameters, effect version – all of these will likely be less than 128.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="todo3" src="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/midi-sysex/scan2.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the DigiTech engineers had gone with my approach, "send" bytes would not resemble "real" bytes, and they wouldn't be able to use hex dumps for spot checks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you know another reason, please reach out!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Casting pig iron at the Iroquois smelter</title>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pig iron smelter" src="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/casting-pig-iron-at-the-iroquois-smelter/pig-iron.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;High-resolution scans of this image are available at the &lt;a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/det.4a08071/"&gt;Library of Congress website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This photograph shows men making pig iron at a place called the Iroquois smelter in Chicago sometime between 1890 and 1901. Molten iron was poured via a central channel to fill the small, regular trenches on the ground to form ingots. Once cooled, the ingots were broken apart from one another and readied for transport or storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smelter's brick structure has church-like arches, and the beams of light flowing through smoke suggest burning incense. The beauty is undeniable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this image also contains evil. The same smoke that gives form to light was undoubtedly life-shortening for workers at the smelter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m reminded of this passage from Robert Adams’s essay &lt;em&gt;Photographing Evil&lt;/em&gt; from his book &lt;a href="https://aperture.org/books/beauty-in-photography/"&gt;Beauty in Photography&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="quote"&gt;
"When we are young, we want art that is filled with the bitter facts, because we believe that evil can be overcome if we face it; when we grow older and begin to doubt this optimistic belief, we want art that does not simply reinforce the pain of our disillusionment.”
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photographs like this one meet the requirements of young and old alike; "[they] urge reform, but seem to suggest that the need for it is not the most important thing to be said of life."&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>October 2021</title>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent most of October studying and working. I'm currently in the Advanced Programming module of the &lt;a href="https://bradfieldcs.com/csi/"&gt;Bradfield CSI&lt;/a&gt; which covers the Go programming language in depth. Learning the guts behind some of Go's core features – goroutines, channels, the scheduler – has been rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;October was my second month working at a large tech company, and it's still good. One of the best parts of working at a larger-but-not-quite-enormous tech company is that I'm finally working hands-on with technologies that I only knew by name before. I've been having a lot of moments where I go something like &lt;em&gt;"oh that's what Airflow is for."&lt;/em&gt; It's not just that I have more tools, it's that I've seen how other people use them effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Reading&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class="quote"&gt;
"There is always a subjective aspect in landscape art, something in the picture that tells us as much about who is behind the camera as about what is in front of it."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did my annual re-read of Robert Adams's &lt;a href="https://aperture.org/books/beauty-in-photography/"&gt;Beauty in Photography&lt;/a&gt; in October. It's short – just eight brief essays in fewer than 100 pages of text – but it is so full of insight. It's probably the book that means the most to me. I first read it at an important time, and it was enormously clarifying for my own work. In particular, Adams's insistence that great landscape photographs must have an autobiographical element led me to my best photographs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Watching&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This short film about an diver who maintains Mexico City's sewage system is excellent. I'm not sure how I ended up on it, but I'm glad I did!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw Dune and thought it was great. I like everything Denis Villeneuve does, so that's not much of surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Bond: New Sequel was not great. The first half was good, but the second half was bloated with a videogame-like body count and cloying ending. Also the big maguffin was NANOMACHINES. Stupid! I yearn for the days when 007's big mission is getting ahold of a special typewriter like in &lt;em&gt;From Russia with Love&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Listening&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://grouper.bandcamp.com/"&gt;Grouper&lt;/a&gt; released an album, &lt;a href="https://grouper.bandcamp.com/album/shade"&gt;Shade&lt;/a&gt;, in October. I particularly like the song Unclean Mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" class="bandcamp-player" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3927818988/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/track=2090522723/transparent=true/" seamless&gt;&lt;a href="https://grouper.bandcamp.com/album/shade"&gt;Shade by Grouper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've also been listening to &lt;a href="https://djseinfeld.bandcamp.com/"&gt;DJ Seinfeld&lt;/a&gt;'s new album, &lt;a href="https://djseinfeld.bandcamp.com/album/mirrors"&gt;Mirrors&lt;/a&gt;. I listened to this track a lot:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A brief anecdote about a good leader</title>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;A lifetime ago, I worked on products at an early stage startup. One of these was an offering for live chat agents, the people who you message in the chat bubbles that pop up on web pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My team was a few weeks from launching a prototype with our first customer, and we presented our progress at a company all-hands. During that meeting, a coworker suggested that we go to the customer’s website and send a message to one of the chat agents live to show everyone how such a system usually works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the co-founders immediately shot the idea down. “How would you like it if someone showed up unannounced and interrupted your work?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I like most about the co-founder’s response is that he went straight for the moral reason. He didn’t say it could be bad for the business (it probably wouldn’t have been). To him, the biggest issue is that it wasn’t considerate – we shouldn’t waste a chat agent’s time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still think about this brief exchange. When I left that company, I had an exit interview with that co-founder where I mentioned how much of an impression his response made on me. He didn’t remember it at all, even after I recounted it in detail. I realized his response was just a reflex for him, and I think that’s more evidence of his integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the kind of person I want to work for or with: ethical and conscientious without even having to try.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>The value of running your adversary's strategy in-house</title>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is written with the assumption that you know what a market maker is and what an order book is. For a solid primer, check out the &lt;a href="https://a16z.com/2021/02/17/payment-for-order-flow/"&gt;first three sections of this opinion piece&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If I should make any corrections to this post, please reach out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Market making versus liquidity taking&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High frequency trading (HFT) firms run strategies that broadly fall into two categories: making and taking. Market making strategies add bids and asks to trading venues’ order books, making it possible for other market participants to quickly convert a security into cash and vice-versa. Conversely, liquidity-taking strategies execute on existing bids or asks, removing them from order books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you make markets, one of your biggest risks is failing to cancel stale quotes. If the price of the security moves, your offers to sell could now be too low, or your quotes to buy could now be too high. Then when someone executes against those stale quotes, you lose money, and they make some. This is called being “picked off.” When you’re running a taking strategy, you’re actively looking for quotes that you can pick off: too-high bids and too-low asks are what you want to execute against.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why speed matters so much in HFT: if you’re a market maker and you don’t cancel your stale quotes fast enough, a liquidity taker will execute on them and eat your lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Building the adversary in-house&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than raw speed, how else can makers avoid getting picked off by takers? One interesting answer is that HFT firms doing market making should also have an in-house team running a taking strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The taking team hunts for stale quotes from any market participant. When they find a quote they can pick off for a profit, and it comes from outside the firm, they execute against the order and make some money. If the quote comes from inside the firm, they tell the market making team to cancel it so it won’t be picked off by a competitor &lt;a href="https://www.echevarria.io/blog/value-of-in-house-adversary/index.html#note"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sps.ed.ac.uk/staff/donald-mackenzie"&gt;Donald MacKenzie&lt;/a&gt; describes the (unintended) results of such an approach in his book &lt;a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691211381/trading-at-the-speed-of-light"&gt;Trading at the Speed of Light&lt;/a&gt; (p 195):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="quote"&gt;
“Attempts to take ... had the unintended, emergent consequence of increasing the profitability of the firm's market making algorithms. The latter would be to a degree protected from taking algorithms in the wider market by the fact that one of the firm's own taking algorithms might well cause the cancellation of a making order before it could be picked off"
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The taking team protected the whole firm’s profitability not by directly looking for flaws in the making team’s strategy – it was a black box to them – but simply by trying to pick off any market participant. Having a taking mindset and taking incentives helped the team find and plug holes in the firm’s making strategy that the making team didn’t know about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HFT maker/taker relationship is inherently adversarial, and having both sides within the same firm partially insulates it from outside competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]&lt;i id="note"&gt;
This is a slightly inaccurate simplification – I didn’t want to muddy the explanation. The taking team doesn’t directly tell the making team to cancel their order because the taking team doesn't actually know which orders belong to them. The taking team just sees an order they want to execute against and a separate system within the firm decides whether to execute against it (another firm’s order) or cancel it (the firm's order).
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>September 2021</title>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;My cohort of the &lt;a href="https://bradfieldcs.com/csi/"&gt;Bradfield CSI&lt;/a&gt; started in earnest last month, and it has been exceptional as Bradfield always is. So far the most mind-blowing part has been learning about and doing low-level optimization – doing loop unrolling, inlining functions, exploiting microarchitecture. It feels like black magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also joined a &lt;a href="https://robinhood.com/"&gt;larger tech company&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://careers.robinhood.com/"&gt;hiring&lt;/a&gt;) in September, and so far my experience has been good. Coming from startups, there’s a lot to like – mature engineering practices, formalized onboarding, incredible scale, and, let’s face it, better pay. In hindsight, I shouldn’t have been as apprehensive as I was to join a bigger company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Watching&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris at Clickspring is back with more videos about the Antikythera mechanism. In this one, he speculates about what the workshop where the mechanism was built was like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="youtube-embed-container"&gt;

    allowfullscreen
  &gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Reading&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew C. Klein wrote two solid free posts this month in &lt;a href="https://theovershoot.co/"&gt;The Overshoot&lt;/a&gt;, his newsletter about macroeconomics. In &lt;a href="https://theovershoot.co/p/the-federal-reserve-wonders-what"&gt;The Federal Reserve Wonders What "Maximum Employment" Means&lt;/a&gt;, he examines the Fed consistently underestimated maximum employment in the wake of the Great Recession and how that’s interacting with Fed policy today. In &lt;a href="https://theovershoot.co/p/americas-inflation-story-is-entering"&gt;America's Inflation Story Is Entering a New Phase&lt;/a&gt;, Klein looks at where and why inflation is showing up. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="quote"&gt;
“The possibility that some hotels, airlines, and car rental agencies increased prices too much over the summer in the expectation of a snapback of price-insensitive business travel, and are now reversing course”
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love this kind of thinking about inflation – the focus on very specific mechanisms instead of “quantity of money go up, inflation do up.” That’s not to say that the quantity of money doesn’t affect inflation. But it’s important to lay out channels and mechanisms to make plausible hypotheses about when and where it will appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan Luu wrote &lt;a href="https://danluu.com/in-house/"&gt;another winner&lt;/a&gt; this month, this time on the value of in-house expertise. Why does Twitter have a kernel team? Because at a certain scale, you run into kernel problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/234730/zero-to-one-by-peter-thiel-with-blake-masters/"&gt;Zero to One&lt;/a&gt; by Peter Thiel was excellent. What I like most is his disdain for competition (informed by philospher René Girard).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="quote"&gt;
"More than anything else, competition is an ideology––the ideology––that pervades our society and distorts our thinking. We preach competition, internalize its necessity, and enact its commandments; and as a result, we trap ourselves within it––even though the more we compete, the less we gain."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do you avoid competition? You differentiate yourself by choosing a path, making a plan, and committing to it. Optimizing for optionality is a great way to get stuck in a highly competitive profession that makes you miserable and dulls your achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(On a similar note, I re-read Byrne Hobart’s piece &lt;a href="https://byrnehobart.medium.com/reasoning-from-first-principles-the-dumbest-thing-smart-people-do-46ff1cbba867"&gt;Reasoning From First Principles: The Dumbest Thing Smart People Do&lt;/a&gt;. You can see a lot of Thiel’s influence there.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
